# Machine Learning Portfolio by Juan Felipe Campuzano
This repository is to act like a high level overview of some interesting machine learning projects I've worked on. I'll provide a short description here for convenience.
All of these projects are in Python.
## PROJECT 1: MNIST digit recognizer
- Created a tool that identifies handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).
- Used Kaggle's datasets to train and evaluate the model.
- Preprocessed the images using normalization and binning techniques. 
- Optimized a Convolutional Neural Network to reach the highest accuracy.
- Performed error analysis to make decisions to improve model performance.
